        <p><font color="white"> Hello and welcome to my online portfolio! My name is Ethan Reuse and I am currently pursuing my MS in GIS and Web Map Programming from the University of Wisconsin Madision.  I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2016 with a Bachelor's in Geography and am still an avid part of Hokie nation.  In my free time I love to go hiking, kayaking, exploring and doing anything adventurous outside.  I was born in Midlothian, Virginia and have lived in the Richmond area ever since after college.  My first job after college I worked as a Automation Analyst for the Chesterfield County Parks and Rec Department where I worked on creating ArcGIS Online Applications for public use as well as assisting the Park's Department Planner in developing a master plan by creating visual aides and maps.  MY second and most recent position is working in the GIS Department at Timmons Group.  Over the past two years I have worked on several projects for Dominion Energy, VDOT, and the State of New Mexico and I could not be happier!  I am very interested in the web design aspect of mapping, more specifically web apps in ArcGIS Online.  Feel free to contact me if you have any other questions! </font></p></section>
